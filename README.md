## Description

This is a command-line application that takes in information about employees on a software engineering team and generates an HTML webpage that displays summaries for each person.

## Aims

1. Given a command-line application that accepts user input, when I'm prompted for my team members and their information an HTML file is generated that displays a nicely formatted team roster based on user input.
2. When I click on an email address in the HTML then my default email program opens and populates the `To:` field of the email with the address.
3. When I click on the GitHub username then that GitHub profile opens in a new tab.
4. When I start the application then I am prompted to enter the team manager’s name, employee ID, email address, and office number.
5. When I enter the team manager’s name, employee ID, email address, and office number then I am presented with a menu with the option to add an engineer or an intern or to finish building my team.
6. When I select the engineer option then I am prompted to enter the engineer’s name, ID, email, and GitHub username, and I am taken back to the menu.
7. When I select the intern option then I am prompted to enter the intern’s name, ID, email, and school, and I am taken back to the menu.
8. When I decide to finish building my team then I exit the application, and the HTML is generated.
